# WiFi-Call USB AKA integration


The existing engine factory can now explicitly select a standalone USB mTLS
client instead of PhoneAkaBackend. Existing phone configurations remain valid.
The USB client is copied into the reviewed hardened engine stage, without GUI
or repo runtime dependencies. USB Studio offers a foreground opt-in bridge
session, at most 300 seconds, <=32 authentications, revoked on stop. It listens
only on 127.0.0.1; a separately provisioned private tunnel is required between
machines. Certificate CA validation, both peer pins, client certificates and
short-lived scoped token remain mandatory. No arbitrary APDU route exists.

Provisioned certificates/private keys are never generated from public CI
fixtures. Keep configuration and keys in owner-only storage (Linux mode0600;
Windows private owner ACL). Supply an actually discovered USIM AID and proven
AT port; never substitute the K3770 SELECT evidence as proof of authentication.
Run: `python -m nexvary_usim_lab bridge --config /private/session.json --consent`.
The portable EXE accepts the same `bridge --config ... --consent` arguments.

Bridge configuration keys: serial_port, device_key, aid, token, server_cert,
server_key, client_ca, client_pin, port. Token is a freshly provisioned random
32–128 character base64url value matching the engine configuration; port must
be an explicit 1–65535 loopback port. Do not put secrets in command-line args.

Engine private configuration keys: backend="usb", port, device_key, token,
server_ca, client_cert, client_key, server_pin; optional identity is an explicitly
owner/operator-provisioned carrier NAI. Neither project extracts IMSI/Ki/OPc or
invents an identity. `NEXVARY_ENGINE_AUTH_FILE` selects the owned mode0600 file.

Hardware/operator gates still required: real CCHO/CGLA support, actual USIM AKA
SUCCESS or SYNC_FAILURE, authorized subscriber NAI, ePDG reachability, entitlement,
IKEv2/IPsec, IMS registration, incoming/outgoing calls and audio. No call server
or user's deployed WiFi-Call installation was changed. No claimed successful
call or live carrier authentication is contained in this release.
